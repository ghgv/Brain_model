# Brain_model
The files in this repository belong to the code annexed to my final work on Artificial Intelligence related to mathematical models of the brain for the M.Sc in A.I.

The OjaÂ´s rule file is a file that helps calculating the principal components as an iteration process.

The Modern Hopfield Network is an implementation of that type of network and also implements a matrix softmax function.

The classic Hopfield Network is an implementation of a "classic" hopfield network.
